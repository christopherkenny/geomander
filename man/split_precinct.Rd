\title{Split a Precinct}
\usage{
split_precinct(lower, precinct, split_by, lower_wt, split_by_id, epsg = 3857)
}
\arguments{
\item{lower}{The lower geography that makes up the precinct, this is often a
block level geography.}

\item{precinct}{The single precinct that you would like to split.}

\item{split_by}{The upper geography that you want to split precinct by}

\item{lower_wt}{Optional. Numeric weights to give to each precinct, typically
VAP or population.}

\item{split_by_id}{Optional. A string that names a column in split_by that
identifies each observation in split_by}

\item{epsg}{numeric EPSG code to planarize to. Default is 3857.}
}
\value{
sf data frame with precinct split
}
\description{
States often split a precinct when they create districts but rarely provide the
geography for the split precinct. This allows you to split a precinct using a
lower geography, typically blocks.
}
