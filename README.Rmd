Focuses on creating data sets and other tools that help make understanding gerrymandering faster and easier. Designed for easy preparation to run simulation analysis with the R package redist, but is aimed at the geographic aspects of redistricting, not partitioning methods. Most of these tools are gathered from seminar papers and do not correspond to a single publication.

## Installation

You can install the released version of geomander from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("geomander")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("christopherkenny/geomander")
```

## Examples

A very common task is aggregating block data to precincts.

```{r example, results = 'hide'}
library(geomander)
library(tidyverse)
 
# load precincts
data('va18sub')

# create block data
block <- create_block_table(state = 'VA', county = '087')  

# match the geographies
matches <- geo_match(from = block, to = va18sub)

# Aggregate
prec <- block2prec(block_table = block, matches = matches)
```

Other important tasks include breaking data into pieces by blocks underlying them.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(geomander)
library(tidyverse)
 
# load precincts
data("va18sub")

# subset to target area
va18sub <- va18sub %>% filter(COUNTYFP == '087')
```

Then we can get common block data:
```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
block <- create_block_table(state = 'VA', county = '087')  
```

And estimate down to blocks
```{r}
disagg <- geo_estimate_down(from = va18sub, to = block, wts = block$vap, value = va18sub$G18USSRSTE)
```
